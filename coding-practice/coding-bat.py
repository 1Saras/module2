#Q1
#Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.

#def count_evens(numlist):
#    num_even = 0
#    for number in numlist:
#        if number %2 == 0:
#            num_even +=1
#    print(num_even)
##        
#count_evens([2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) #→ 3
#count_evens([2, 2, 0]) #→ 3
#count_evens([1, 3, 5]) #→ 0


#Q2

#Given an array of ints, return True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere.
#
#def has22(nums):
#     for 
#
#        
#        print("True")

#has22([1, 2, 2]) → True
#has22([1, 2, 1, 2]) → False
#has22([2, 1, 2]) → False




#Q3
#Return the sum of the numbers in the array, but ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 until the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). Return 0 for no numbers.
#sum67([1, 2, 2]) → 5
#sum67([1, 2, 2, 6, 99, 99, 7]) → 5
#sum67([1, 1, 6, 7, 2]) → 4

#Q4
#Return the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string.
#
#count_hi('abc hi ho') → 1
#count_hi('ABChi hi') → 2
#count_hi('hihi') → 2


#Q5
#Write the letters 'A' to 'Z' (in upper case) to the console, placing each letter on a new line.
#
#For every third letter, write it to the console in lowercase instead.
#
#For every fourth letter, write its numeric position in the alphabet to the console instead (e.g. instead of outputting 'D' output '4').
#
#If a letter satisfies both rules 2 and 3, write out its numeric position followed by the letter in lowercase (e.g. 'L' should be output as '12l').
